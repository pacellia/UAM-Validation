    Implements:
      - w(z): solve (1+z) * cos(w)^2 = exp(-tan(w)), with bracket (-pi/2+eps, pi/2-eps)
      - beta_dev(w) = |1 - 2 sin(w/2)/w|, with beta_dev(0)=0, ~ w^2/24 as w->0
      - E(z)^2 = Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + (1 - Omega_m) * sec(w)^2 * [1 / (1 + beta_dev(w)*z/(1+z))]^2
      - Distances: D_H, D_M, D_A, D_L, mu(z) = 5 log10(D_L) + 25 + Δ (Δ marginalized in likelihood)

    Unit tests to be defined in docs/test_theory.ipynb as per plan.
