# THEORY NOTES (UAM)
    - β_dev(w) = |1 - 2 sin(w/2)/w| with β_dev(0)=0, small-angle limit w^2/24.
    - w(z) defined by (1+z) cos^2(w) = exp(-tan(w)), solved with bracket (-π/2+ε, π/2-ε).
    - E(z)^2 = Ω_m (1+z)^3 + (1-Ω_m) sec^2(w) [1/(1 + β_dev(w) z/(1+z))]^2.
    - Distances: D_H, D_M, D_A, D_L; μ(z)=5 log10(D_L)+25+Δ; Δ marginalized.
    - Ω_m,UAM fixed: π^3/100.
    - Document ε and solver fallback details here.
